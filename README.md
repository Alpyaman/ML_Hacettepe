Hacettepe University Machine Learning Lesson Codes
There is 2 documents;
First of all, knn.py is the K-Nearest Neighbor from scratch without using sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.
The other document is the jupyter codes for analyzing e Wine Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

knn.py is not going to be debug due to code that I wrote for only the wine dataset.
